## visualization part(this is implemented by Django framework)


build a lightweight website by Django, and by taking advantange of the data, I do some visualizations,details are:  <br>
1. display all the flight numbers in different cities. <br>
2. display all the population in different cities. <br>
3. display top3 cities which have the most flight numbers in Chrismtmas day. <br>
4. make comparison among flight numbers, population, and GPD among cities. <br>
5. interact map with data. <br>
6. login and register module. <br>


If you want to run these codes, please make sure you have downloaded django library.


Here are the urls you can use(or you can click the buttons in the website )<br>
