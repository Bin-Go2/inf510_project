I nearly spent a whole week to fulfill the scraping part beacuse all the filght websites have a strong anti-scarping strategy. I can't use requests library to access these information directly. And during this period, I stimulated the cookie, header, analyzed js. But finally I decided to use selenium to atumoated scrape the information like users. It sepnd a lot of time waiting for the searching and stroing. <br>\n",
    "    And when it comes to the visualization and analysis part,the problem for is how to display the result. And I heard Django was a good framework to illustrate information as htmls. So I learned it and find it's pretty easy to build a lightweight website via Django. But there are still troubles when I use it. The first thing is displaying. What I know is just simple html、css languages. They can't display so well. So I searched the Internet and used a framework called bootstrap to help me. Another thing is front-end interaction, even though I can use SQL to get the information I want, I don't know how to transfer it to the front end. After several trials, I know how to use 'context' (a django term) to transfer my data and changing its encoing foramt to make it compatible. "

Maybe after that I will fulfill the booking module and refunding module to enhance the user interation rather than just showing the results. Besides, in this project, the UI is not so good and I didn't make it flexible, so it will display well in the Mac 15-inch screen. But in other screen, because of the size design, it will not be compative and display bad. After that I will make it more flexible. Another thing is the database design, here I don't consider it too much and for the sake of reduing searching time, I used some spacing redundancy. After that I can redegin it and make it more effective."
